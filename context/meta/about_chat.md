# About This Chat System

## What Is This?

This is an AI-powered chat system integrated into my portfolio website. It's designed to help you learn about my professional background, projects, and experience.

## What Can I Ask?

Feel free to ask about:
- My work experience and career history
- Technical skills and programming languages I use
- Projects I've worked on
- My approach to problem-solving
- Hobbies and community involvement (like FIRST robotics mentoring)
- How to connect with me professionally

## What Are Its Limitations?

- I can only answer questions about topics covered in my portfolio
- I don't have access to real-time information or current events
- I can't help with general questions unrelated to my background
- I might not have every detail about my experience - some things are better discussed in person!

## How Does It Work?

This chat uses local LLM inference with multiple layers of safety checks. It's designed with security as a primary concern since it's exposed to the public internet.

The system is built with:
- Python and FastAPI for the backend
- Ollama for local LLM inference
- Multiple validation and safety layers

The architecture itself is a demonstration of how to build secure AI systems - it's part of my portfolio!
