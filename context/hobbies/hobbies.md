# About Me

## Family First

In my free time I'm a father and husband first. Traveling to swim meets, getting kiddos to band and orchestra practice, helping with homework.

## Tinkering & Technology

But I also like to tinker. I build computers, practice with code, read about technology, and created this website and chatbot. I like strategy games and playing Minecraft with my girls on our own server.

## Active Pursuits

I like to ski and play golf even though I'm very uncoordinated and not athletic by any means.

## Reading & Cooking

I enjoy reading fiction and nonfiction, particularly history or about neuroscience. Books like Robert Wright's *Why Buddhism is True* and Rick Hanson's *Buddha's Brain* have shaped how I think about cognition and problem-solving.

I enjoy cooking on my Traeger smoker and trying new foods. There's something satisfying about the patience required for low-and-slow cooking - it mirrors the kind of deliberate, thoughtful approach I value in my work.
