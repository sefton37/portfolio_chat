# Problem-Solving Approach

## My Philosophy

I believe in understanding problems deeply before jumping to solutions. Good engineering is about making the right tradeoffs, not just making things work.

## Key Principles

### 1. Understand Before Solving
- Ask "why" multiple times to find root causes
- Understand the context and constraints
- Consider who will use and maintain the solution

### 2. Start Simple, Iterate
- Build the simplest thing that could work
- Get feedback early and often
- Add complexity only when needed

### 3. Design for Failure
- Assume things will go wrong
- Build in observability and debugging
- Plan for graceful degradation

### 4. Document Intent
- Code explains "what", comments explain "why"
- Architecture decisions should be recorded
- Future maintainers (including future me) will thank you

### 5. Learn from Others
- Read other people's code
- Stay curious about new approaches
- Share what you learn

## Applied to This Chat System

This portfolio chat system embodies these principles:
- Multiple layers of defense (assume things will fail)
- Simple, focused responsibilities per layer
- Extensive logging and metrics
- Clear documentation of design decisions
