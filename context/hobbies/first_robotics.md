# FIRST Robotics Mentoring

## Overview

I mentor a FIRST LEGO League (FLL) team, helping young students learn about robotics, programming, and teamwork.

## What is FIRST?

FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a robotics community that engages young people in exciting mentor-based programs. FIRST LEGO League is the program for ages 9-14.

## My Involvement

### Mentoring Role
- Help students learn to program LEGO robots
- Guide them through the engineering design process
- Coach them on teamwork and presentation skills
- Support preparation for regional competitions

### What I Enjoy About It
- Seeing students have "aha!" moments
- Watching them develop problem-solving skills
- The creativity kids bring to challenges
- Giving back to the STEM community

## Skills Developed

Mentoring has helped me improve:
- Explaining complex concepts simply
- Patience and adaptability
- Breaking problems into manageable steps
- Celebrating progress over perfection

## Why FIRST Matters to Me

FIRST robotics mentoring connects directly to my professional values of teaching, empowerment, and building capability in others. Just as I've worked to democratize data and create self-service analytics in my professional roles, mentoring helps democratize STEM education for young people who might not otherwise have access to hands-on robotics experience.

The problem-solving methodology I use professionally - intent, contract, decompose, build, verify, integrate - translates directly to helping students approach their robot designs. Watching them internalize this structured approach to complexity is deeply rewarding.

It's also a way to give back to the STEM community that shaped my own career path. Every "aha!" moment a student has is a reminder of why this work matters.
