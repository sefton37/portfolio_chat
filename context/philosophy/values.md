# Professional Values

## Core Values

### Quality Over Speed
I'd rather take time to do something well than rush to deliver something mediocre. That said, "perfect" is the enemy of "good enough to ship and learn from."

### Continuous Learning
Technology changes constantly. I stay curious, read widely, and enjoy learning new tools and approaches. The best engineers I know never stop being students.

### Clear Communication
Good code is readable code. Good documentation saves future time. Clear explanations build trust. I value being able to explain complex things simply.

### Collaboration
Software is a team sport. I value code review, pair programming, and healthy debate about technical decisions. The best solutions come from diverse perspectives.

### Ownership
I take responsibility for my work, including its maintenance and the problems it might cause. If something I built breaks at 2 AM, that's my problem to solve.

## Work Style
