## Summary

I'm a data-driven strategist who turns complexity into clarity. With a background in marketing analytics and a deep toolkit spanning Power BI, Azure Synapse, and the common data model, I specialize in building decision intelligence systems that don't just report, they direct.

Over the past several years, I've led agile teams and engineered data products that improve business performance at scale — from automating nationwide sales reporting to architecting insight pipelines that reshape marketing strategy. Whether it's integrating CRM with ad data for granular ROAS tracking or empowering teams through self-service BI, my goal is simple: make data not just accessible, but actionable.

I thrive at the intersection of curiosity and execution with equal parts analyst, builder, and translator. I ask "so what?" with every dataset, and "what if?" with every dashboard.

Outside of work, I'm a student of global systems (BA in International Relations, MBA with honors), a lifelong writer, and an aspiring game developer continually tinkering, always learning.
